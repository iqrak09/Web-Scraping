# Web-Scraping

Web scraping is when you use computer programs to pull data from websites. Python is a favorite for this because it's easy to use and there are lots of helpful libraries for it.

Steps to Scrape Websites -->

Figure out what to scrape: Decide which website and page you want to pull data from.
Check out the page: Use your browser's developer tools to look closely at the parts you want to get.
Make a request: Grab the page's content with the requests library.
Break down the HTML: Use libraries like BeautifulSoup to get the data you need from the HTML.
Grab the info: Use the broken-down HTML to find and collect the info you're after.
Save the info: Put the collected data in a format you like (like CSV, JSON, or a database).


Think about the right way to do it,

- Follow the website's rules: Look at the website's robots.txt to find out what you can and can't scrape.
- Don't go overboard: Don't make too many requests quickly to avoid crashing the website's server.
- Make sure it's legal: Make sure you're not breaking any rules or laws by scraping the website.
